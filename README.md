Open your project folder in VS Code. Make sure you select the interpreter from your virtual environment (venv) to ensure VS Code uses the correct Python version and packages.

Press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette.
Type Python: Select Interpreter and choose the one that is located inside your project's venv folder.

This command lists all the packages installed in your virtual environment (along with their versions) and saves them to requirements.txt. Others can then set up their own venv and use 

> pip install -r requirements.txt 

to install all the necessary packages.
